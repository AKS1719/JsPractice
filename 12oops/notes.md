# Javascript and classes

JavaScript does indeed have classes, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. However, it's important to understand that JavaScript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance model. This means that under the hood, JavaScript's class system is built on top of the prototype chain.
